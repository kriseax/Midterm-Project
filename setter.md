# Setter

There is always one setter on the court at all times in any lineup. 

Some would argue that the setter is the most important position in volleyball. This is based on the phenomenon that without a good set, nobody will be able to attack well resulting in a lack of points being scored. But if you think about it, if the libero is bad, then there will be nobody to pass the ball well, and if the attackers are bad, the team won't be scoring points regardless of how good the set is. This is why most people just go with the belief that every position is equally important to the success of a team. 

This position needs a very specific skill set in order to succeed. Setter need to have exceptional spatial awareness, depth perception, and the ability to set the ball anywhere on the court, whether its behind them, across the court, or an easy set somewhere close to them.
