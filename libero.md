# Libero

In a lineup, there is always one libero and they are on the court for nearly every single play of the game.

Liberos are the *best* and *most reliable* passers and back row defenders on the team. They are able to constantly be in the back row because they sub in and out for the middles as they rotate into the back row. Liberos also wear a different color jersey from the rest of the team to indicate to the referees that they are allowed to pass freely onto and off of the court. 

Since liberos only play in the back row, they obviously have no part in the offensive attack other than passing the ball high and in the middle of the court so that the setter can make a good set to one of the hitters. Much like the middles being offensive captains because they are in the front row only, liberos are usually defensive captains because they only reside in the back. Liberos are also traditionally the shortest players on the team.
