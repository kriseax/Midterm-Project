# Introduction

First off, the five main positions in volleyball are:

1. **Outside Hitter**
2. **Opposite Hitter**
3. **Middle**
4. **Libero**
5. **Setter**

Check out this [diagram](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/4f/56/a5/4f56a5564324c8d8bdfca3035fd9dab1.png) that shows where each position is in their base rotations. 

In this program, you will learn about the specific positions. But if you don't know anything about volleyball, feel free to read about [the history of volleyball](https://www.britannica.com/sports/volleyball) and [the rules of the game.](https://usavolleyball.org/play/rules-of-volleyball/)
