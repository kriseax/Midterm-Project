# About the Program Creator

My name is Jake Smith and I am the creator of this program. The purpose of this is for my midterm assignment in one of my Information Technology classes at the University of Missouri.

I am currently learning Python, JavaScript, and HTML. Here is how I would have coded the rules paragraph in the [introduction] in an HTML syntax:

<html>
  <head><title>Rules of Volleyball</title></head>
    <body>
       <p>The complete rules are extensive. But simply, play proceeds as follows: a player on one of the teams begins a 'rally' by serving the ball (tossing or releasing it and then hitting it with a hand or arm), from behind the back boundary line of the court, over the net, and into the receiving team's court. The receiving team must not let the ball be grounded within their court. The team may touch the ball up to 3 times but individual players may not touch the ball twice consecutively. Typically, the first two touches are used to set up for an attack, an attempt to direct the ball back over the net in such a way that the serving team is unable to prevent it from being grounded in their court. For a complete list of rules click

        </a>.
      </p>
    </body>



Since VS Code will not allow the HTML program to properly display itself without a screenshot, click [here](https://imgur.com/cT2dRrm) to see the example.
